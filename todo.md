- update seed data ( internal link is now {slug: ...., documentId: ....})
- in all hooks etc.: only search within current tenant
- add breadcrumb and parent selector to all pages (currently only detail page)
- autosave disabled. on lang change, make save draft. otherwise, if i switch to italiano, add some text, switch to french, then italian text is gone.
- url can be generated by the breadcrumb. do we need the breadcrumb on internalLinks as well?
- we should pass through req on all operations from the localApi, since we have replicas on prod.
- write tests for all of this
- handle unpublish:if page is changing to unpublished, we need to cascade down!
