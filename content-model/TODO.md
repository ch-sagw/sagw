Todos:
- access control model (which types are SAGW only? which are FG only?)
- modules mapping -> which modules can be used in which context?
- add hidden texts where appropriate

Questions:
- CtaContactPersonSection -> in design->sections exists only in dark. but on earlyCareerAwardPage, it is in bright mode.
- news teaser item has a date. news detail has no date?
- define PLC content. e.g. activities -> magazine detail -> author ??
- Beat Immenhauser currently has a link to or-cid.org in his profile text. Will this still be needed?
- Will rich text block always have a white background?
- Can we reuse PersonTeaser in CtaContactPersonSection? Can people be defined in the CtaContactPersonSection who are not part of the team?
- OrderPublicationForm -> Do you ship the publications internationally? The old form https://www.sagw.ch/sagw/aktuell/publikationen/bestellen?publication=Bulletin%201%2F25%3A%20Intelligenz&cHash=3b2a562861a015a5f959d5e7f9882712 uses additional fields compared to the current design. Which ones are needed anymore?
- Do you want to serve the FAQs as structured data? PRO: better machine readability, FAQs might show up in Google Search Results, eventually better visibility/accuracy in AI powered search. CONS: pretty much the PRO points -> decreased on page traffic
 - Publications are currently not part of the Project Details page. Is this on purpose or a mistake?
 - Can the Fachgesellschaften have anything else as footer logo than on of the three svgs: 'Institute of Swiss Academy...', 'Member of Swiss Academy' or 'Supported by Swiss Academy...'
 - The Fachgesellschaften have very diverse variants of the contact block in the footer. What needs to be possible in the future?
 - Video-Handling: Responsive videos manually optimized with multiple sources <-> Single source and automatically optimized video and delivery
 - Accordion content: do you expect anything else than RTE to be placed within an accordion?
 
- Are there FAQs which are reused on various pages? Would it make sense to have the FAQ entries as PLC content? -> YES OPLC
