- containerize local db
  - seed function?
  - reproduction from prod to local dev?
- vrt:
  - when logging meta, then config.rootDir is '/src/src' ???
  - publish docker to use it in github workflow
- test integration of backup/restore
- documentation
- order npm scripts
- staging and prod environment... release-please?
- add sentry
- cron jobs: slack message instead of mail?
- cron jobs: Send mail on failure
- document in backup-restore files, which env variables are required
- document all env variables
- cron jobs invoke one method, which itself is wrapped in try/catch. Test to see if this is enough, or if the GET handler needs a try/catch as well.
