# Firewall
Vercel offers a built-in Web Application Firewall (WAF). Eventually it will be necessary to customize a certain rule or create an exception to an existing rule. Vercel offers "Custom Rules" to achieve this. Learn more about the Vercel firewall in general
https://vercel.com/docs/vercel-firewall and about creating custom rules https://vercel.com/docs/vercel-firewall/vercel-waf/custom-rules.

## Defining Custom Rules
Custom Rules can be defined in Vercel under this path:
Project -> Firewall -> Configure

## Monitoring Active Rules
Active Custom Rules can be seen on the Firewall overview page in the bottom right section.
